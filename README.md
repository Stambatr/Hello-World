# Hello-World
First Repository

Hello,

I'm an Electrical Engineer who is starting to dabble more in coding beyond my C, PLC, and industrial robot roots. Specifically I'm learning about XML and Java in order to get into Android Development, at least as a hobby. As I get more job experience, I find myself drawn more to the C - styled programming of ABB robots in the RAPID language, and would like to expand my knowledge base on my own terms.
